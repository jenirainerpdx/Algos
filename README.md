This is truly an adhoc playground/learning environment.  
This is highly disorganized and at some point I'll sort it all out.  

docs directory is some .md files that contain some notes I was taking as I was reading about Search algorithms and some data structures.
src is - well where the code is.  I generally learn through unit testing.  So, the more interesting things may be happening in src/test rather than src/main.
Current exploration is happening in the lambdas directory.  While I dove head first into Scala and streaming things when I was doing work with data engineering, I never felt really fluent with java lambdas and Streams.  So, taking a few steps back and working through some exercises based on Java 8 Lambdas by Richard Warburton.  

You are, of course, always welcome, to leave issues/ comments.  I am delighted for feedback and comments!  But, likely, there is not much to see here.  ;)
