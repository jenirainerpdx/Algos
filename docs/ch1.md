How long to search 1 billion elements:
 - simple search O(n) = 1 billion ms, or 277.78 hours
 - binary search O(log n) = log 1_000_000_000 ms, 29.897352853986 ms
A profound difference

log time:  O(log n)
linear time : O(n)
??: O(n* log n)
n squared:  O(n^2)
factorial time: O(n!)

1.3  O(log n)
1.4  O(n)
1.5  O(n)
1.6  Read the numbers of just the 'A's: 
    worst case is all of them are A entries.  So that would be O(n)
